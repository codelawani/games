Im going to be giving you chunks of code.
You are to create test plans in yaml.
This is an example below(its actually in a yaml code block, observe how the first line starts with a hyphen) showing exactly how I want you to write it
This is only an example, You will have to write new test plans based on the code I give you
```
- Id: 1
  Description: Test the init() method of TicTacToe class to ensure that it initializes the game with a blank board, X as the starting player, and the game_over flag set to False.
  Steps:
    - 1. Create an instance of TicTacToe class with a Tkinter root window.
    - 2. Check that the board attribute of the instance is a list of 9 empty strings.
    - 3. Check that the current_player attribute of the instance is set to "X".
    - 4. Check that the game_over attribute of the instance is set to False.
  Expected: Board attribute is a list of 9 empty strings, current_player attribute is set to "X", and game_over attribute is set to False.
  Actual: Board attribute is a list of 9 empty strings, current_player attribute is set to "X", and game_over attribute is set to False.
  Result: Pass
  Comment: init() method of TicTacToe class initializes the game state as expected.
```
Here's the first bit of code(This is a function that's part of a snake and ladder game module):

```
def update_players(players, name, dice):
    """
    Updates the position of a player on the board, based on the dice roll.

    Args:
        players (dict): A dictionary containing player names mapped
                        to a list of bead and position.
                        dict(name -> [bead,number])
        name (str): The name of the player to update.
        dice (int): The number rolled on the dice.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the updated positions of all players.
                dict(name -> [bead,number])
    """

    def is_snake(position):
        snakes = {16: 4, 33: 20, 48: 24, 62: 56, 78: 69}
        if position in snakes:
            return (position, snakes[position])

    def is_ladder(position):
        ladders = {3: 12, 7: 23, 20: 56, 47: 53, 60: 72, 80: 94}
        if position in ladders:
            return (position, ladders[position])

    player_p = players[name][1]
    currentPos = player_p + dice
    display_name = name.capitalize()
    bluename = colored(display_name, "blue", attrs=["bold"])
    redname = colored(display_name, "red", attrs=["bold"])
    greenName = colored(display_name, "green", attrs=["bold"])
    if is_snake(player_p + dice):
        print(f"A snake âˆ« is found on \"{is_snake(currentPos)[0]}\"\n"
              f"RIP :( you've been  bitten, hope it wasn't a python :) ...")
        print(f"{redname} you're now at {is_snake(player_p + dice)[1]}.\n")
        players[name][1] = is_snake(player_p + dice)[1]
    elif is_ladder(player_p + dice):
        print("Wow! You found a ladder... \n Let's gooo!!")
        print(
            f"{greenName} you're now at \"{is_ladder(currentPos)[1]}\".\n")
        players[name][1] = is_ladder(player_p + dice)[1]
    else:
        players[name][1] += dice
        if players[name][1] > 100:
            players[name][1] = 100
        print(f"{bluename} has now moved to \"{players[name][1]}\".\n")
```
Please I don't want examples, write the test plans for me
Write as many as u can
Please it must be written in a [yaml code block]
i will be very unhappy with u if u do otherwise

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a test plan in YAML for the following function:

```
def play_game():
    """Game engine that runs the game"""
    print("\n"+"WELCOME TO".center(50, "."), "\n")
    print(r"""        /\		     |-----|

Your test plan should include the following:

Test case ID
Description of the test case
Test steps (including input data and expected output)
Expected outcome
Actual outcome
Test result (pass/fail)
Comments (optional)
Please make sure to follow the YAML format exactly as in the example provided:

```
- Id: 1
  Description: Test case description
  Steps:
    - 1. Step 1 description
    - 2. Step 2 description
    - 3. Step 3 description
  Expected: Expected outcome description
  Actual: Actual outcome description
  Result: Pass/Fail
  Comment: Additional comments (optional)
```
For my next prompts, I will only give u a piece of code and u just have to do what I have just instructed.
first start with the one included in this prompt
