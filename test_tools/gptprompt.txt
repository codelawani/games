Im going to be giving you chunks of code.
You are to create test plans in yaml.
This is an example below showing exactly how I want you to write it
This is only an example, You will have to write new test cases based on the code I give you

- Id: 1
  Description: Test the init() method of TicTacToe class to ensure that it initializes the game with a blank board, X as the starting player, and the game_over flag set to False.
  Steps:
    - 1. Create an instance of TicTacToe class with a Tkinter root window.
    - 2. Check that the board attribute of the instance is a list of 9 empty strings.
    - 3. Check that the current_player attribute of the instance is set to "X".
    - 4. Check that the game_over attribute of the instance is set to False.
  Expected: Board attribute is a list of 9 empty strings, current_player attribute is set to "X", and game_over attribute is set to False.
  Actual: Board attribute is a list of 9 empty strings, current_player attribute is set to "X", and game_over attribute is set to False.
  Result: Pass
  Comment: init() method of TicTacToe class initializes the game state as expected.
Here's the first bit of code:

class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self, root):
        """
        Initialize the TicTacToe game with a blank board and X as the starting player.

        Args:
        - root (Tk): The root window for the game.
        """

        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Tic Tac Toe")
        self.root.configure(background='#a7a9be')
        # Initialize game state
        self.board = [" "]*9
        self.current_player = "X"
        self.game_over = False

        # Create game board
        self.board_frame = tk.Frame(
            root, background="blue", )

        self.board_frame.pack()

        self.board_buttons = []
        for i in range(9):
            button = tk.Button(self.board_frame, text="", width=6, height=3, font=("Helvetica", 20),
                               background="#0f0e17", fg="#fffffe", activebackground="#ff8906", highlightbackground="#a7a9be", command=lambda i=i: self.make_move(i))
            button.grid(row=i//3, column=i % 3)
            self.board_buttons.append(button)

        # Create reset button
        self.reset_button = tk.Button(
            root, text="Restart", width=10, background="#f25f4c", activebackground="#e53170", command=self.reset_game)
        self.reset_button.pack(pady=10)
Please make sure to write the test cases in yaml
