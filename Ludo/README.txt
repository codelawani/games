Ludo Game
---------
Ludo is a popular board game that can be played by two to four players. The game is played on a board with four colored areas, and each player has four tokens of the same color. The aim of the game is to be the first player to move all of their tokens from the starting area to the finish area.

Setup
=====
To start the game, each player chooses a color and takes four tokens of that color. The tokens are placed in the starting area of the board, which is the colored area that matches the player's tokens.

Gameplay
========
The game is played in turns, with each player rolling a dice to determine the number of spaces they can move their tokens. The player can move any one of their tokens the number of spaces indicated by the dice. If the player rolls a six, they can roll the dice again and move another token, or they can choose to move the same token again.

If a player lands on a space already occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent's token is sent back to the starting area. If a player rolls a number that would take them past the finish area, they can't move that token and must wait for their next turn.

The first player to move all of their tokens into the finish area wins the game.
